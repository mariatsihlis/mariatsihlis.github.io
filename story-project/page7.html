<p id="six">You still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance<br>
I ain't mad - I just think it's <strike>FUCKED UP</strike> you don't answer fans<br>
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert<br>
you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew<br>
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old<br>
We waited in the blistering cold for you,<br>
four hours and you just said, <span class="largefont"><br>"No."<br></span>
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his <strike>fucking</strike> idol<br>
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do<br>
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to<br>
Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you<br>
you would write <a href="page8.html">back</a></p>
