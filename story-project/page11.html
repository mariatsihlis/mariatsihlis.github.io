this'll be the last package I ever send your ass<br>
It's been six months and still no word - I don't deserve it?<br>
I know you got my last two letters;<br>
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect<br>
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it<br>
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway<br>
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?<br>
