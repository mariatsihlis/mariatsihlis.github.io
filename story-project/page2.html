    <p id="one">My tea's gone <span style="color:lightblue">coldddddddddddddddd </span><br>
     I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all<br>
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all<br>
And even if I could it'll all be <span style="color:gray"> gray,</span><br> but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, <br>that it's not so bad, <br>it's not so <a href="page3.html">bad.</a>
