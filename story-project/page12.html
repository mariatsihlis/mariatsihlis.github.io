<p id="eleven">That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning<br>
Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy<br>
and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call<br>
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall<br>
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it<br>
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it<br>
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you<br> <span class="largefont">SCREAM</span> <br>about it<br>
I hope your conscience<br> <span class="largefont">EATS AT YOU</span><br> and you can't <br><span class="largefont">BREATHE</span><br> without me<br>
See Slim;Shut up bitch! I'm trying to talk!<br>
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk,<br>
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you<br>
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die, too<br>
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge
