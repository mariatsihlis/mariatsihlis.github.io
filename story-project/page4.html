    <p id="three">I wrote you but you still ain't calling<br>
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom<br>
I sent <span class="largefont">2</span> letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em<br>
There probably was a problem at the post office or something<br>
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em<br>
but anyways; <strike> fuck</strike> it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?<br>
My girlfriend's pregnant, too, I'm bout to be a father<br>
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?<br>
I'ma name her <a href="page5.html">Bonnie</a></p>
