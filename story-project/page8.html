<p id="seven">see I'm just like you in a way<br>
I never knew my father neither;<br>
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her<br>
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs<br>
so when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on<br>
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed<br>
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest<br>
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds<br>
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me<br>
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it<br>
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7<br>
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does<br>
She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up<br>
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose<br>
Sincerely yours, <a href="page9.html">Stan</a></p>
